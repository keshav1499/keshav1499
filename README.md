Goals for the weekend-
1. Linux Process Monitor (Mini htop)

Skills you’ll learn: process states, /proc filesystem, CPU/memory usage tracking.

Write a Python/C program that reads from /proc to list running processes, PID, CPU%, memory usage.

Add sorting by CPU/mem usage.

Bonus: Add "kill process" feature.

Why it helps: You’ll understand how Linux exposes process and memory info, and it’s a common OS interview topic.

2. Simple Shell

Skills you’ll learn: system calls (fork(), exec()), command parsing, process creation.

Implement a shell that takes user input and runs commands using execvp().

Handle built-ins like cd and exit.

Add background job support using &.

Why it helps: This is the classic OS project for understanding process creation, scheduling, and I/O redirection.

3. Virtual Memory Simulator

Skills you’ll learn: paging, page replacement algorithms, memory management.

Write a C or Python program that simulates RAM and pages from disk.

Implement FIFO and LRU page replacement.

Show page fault count for a given access sequence.

Why it helps: Paging & replacement algorithms are frequent IBM interview questions.

4. File System Analyzer

Skills you’ll learn: file I/O, inodes, permissions, system calls.

Build a tool that takes a directory path and prints:

File sizes

Permissions (rwx)

Last access & modified times

Bonus: Compare sizes across subdirectories and find largest files.

Why it helps: Teaches how Linux handles file metadata and permissions—often tested in OS/Unix rounds.
